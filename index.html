            <p>Ayo, this song is dedicated<br>
             To all the happy people<br>
             All the happy people who have real nice lives<br>
            And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck<br>

<h3>Verse 1</h3>
<p>I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net<br>
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck<br>
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check<br>
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt<br>
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged<br>
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged<br>
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper<br>
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer<br>
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders<br>
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers<br>
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us<br>
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters<br>
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas<br>
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us<br>
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless<br>
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless<br>
You might also like<br>

<h3>Chorus</h3>

<p>That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill<br>
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal<br>
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here<br>
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear<br>
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill<br>
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal<br>
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here<br>
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear<br>

<h3>Verse 2</h3>
<p class="Verse">
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams<br>
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings<br>
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished<br>
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished<br>
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay<br>
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day<br>
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play<br>
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way<br>
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan<br>
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan<br>
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6<br>
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics<br>
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day<br>
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today<br>
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play<br>
Live half my life and throw the rest away<br>

<h3>Verse 3</h3>
<p class="Verse 3">
There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)<br>
But it's the evil that made me<br>
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)<br>
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame<br>
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame<br>
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name<br>
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain<br>
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom<br>
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)<br>
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em<br>
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em<br>
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em<br>
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em<br>
And while you flaunt 'em<br>
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em<br>
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?<br>
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song<br>
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn<br>
